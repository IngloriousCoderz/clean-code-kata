# clean-code-kata

A NetBeans project used as a benchmark for lessons on Clean Code.

There are two examples here:

1. Button: a very badly written code, refactored into something more readable.
2. Mario: a representation of Nintendo's famous character, with powerups added through different patterns and antipatterns.
3. Christmas Tree: another experiment on decorators and TDD, in which we build a complex Christmas tree with parametric height by splitting the problem into multiple simpler subproblems. The end result will look like this:

```
     qp
    |/\|
   |/ *\|
  |/o* o\|
 |/ o*  *\|
|/**  *   \|
 ----------
     ||
```

Every example is purposedly non-commented and solely documented through unit tests.
