# clean-code-kata

A NetBeans project used as a benchmark for lessons on Clean Code.

There are two examples here:

1. Button: a very badly written code, refactored into something more readable.
2. Mario: a representation of Nintendo's famous character, with powerups added through different patterns and antipatterns.

Every example is purposedly non-commented and documented through unit tests.
